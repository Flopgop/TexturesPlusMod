# TexturesPlusMod

Tired of installing the updated versions of all the Textures+ packs? I made a mod that does it for you!

This mod downloads the updated version of all 4 textures+ packs from the github into your resource pack folder on startup. This is in beta, so there are certain optimizations not present yet.

This is my first ever fabric mod, so it is prone to errors. Please report any issues to the github issues page!

HUGE thanks to:

Traben: https://modrinth.com/user/Traben Flamgop: @flamgop on discord

For both being a lot of help with setting up the IDE/dependencies or straight up letting me use some of their code
